Here's the step-by-step algorithm: (1) Create an empty hash map to store numbers and their indices. (2) Loop through each element with its index. (3) Calculate complement = target - current element. (4) Check if the complement exists in the hash map. (5) If yes, return [map[complement], current index]. (6) If no, add current element and its index to the map. (7) Continue to the next element.
