The optimal solution achieves **O(n) time complexity** by making a single pass through the array, where n is the length of the array. The hash map provides O(1) average-case lookup time. The **space complexity is O(n)** in the worst case, where you might store almost all elements in the hash map before finding the pair. This is a significant improvement over the brute force O(n²) approach that checks every possible pair.
