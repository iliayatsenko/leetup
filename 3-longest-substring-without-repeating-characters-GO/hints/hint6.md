The optimal sliding window solution achieves **O(n) time complexity** because each character is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer when expanding, once by the left pointer when shrinking). The **space complexity is O(min(n, m))** where n is the string length and m is the character set size - in the worst case, the map stores all unique characters in the string, but it's bounded by the alphabet size (e.g., 128 for ASCII, 256 for extended ASCII).
