Here's the algorithm outline: (1) Initialize a hash map, left pointer at 0, and maxLength at 0. (2) Iterate through the string with a right pointer. (3) For each character at right: if it exists in the map AND its stored index is >= left pointer, move left to (stored index + 1). (4) Update the map with the current character's index. (5) Calculate current window length (right - left + 1) and update maxLength if larger. (6) Return maxLength after the loop completes.
