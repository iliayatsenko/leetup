Use a **hash map** (or hash set) to track which characters are currently in your window and their positions. When you encounter a character that's already in the map, you need to move the left pointer to exclude the previous occurrence of that character. Store character positions (indices) in the map so you can quickly jump the left pointer to the right position when a duplicate is found, rather than moving it one step at a time.
