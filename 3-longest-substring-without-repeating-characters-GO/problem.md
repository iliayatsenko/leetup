Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest**
[**substring**]{keyword="substring-nonempty"} without duplicate
characters.

**Example 1:**


    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

**Example 2:**


    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**


    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10`^`4`^
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
