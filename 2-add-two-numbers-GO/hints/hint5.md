Here's the step-by-step algorithm: (1) Initialize a dummy head node and a current pointer, plus a carry variable set to 0. (2) Loop while l1 exists OR l2 exists OR carry > 0. (3) Extract values from current nodes (use 0 if a list is null). (4) Calculate sum = val1 + val2 + carry. (5) Create a new node with value (sum % 10) and attach it to the result list. (6) Update carry = sum / 10. (7) Advance l1 and l2 pointers if they're not null. (8) Return dummy.next as the result.
