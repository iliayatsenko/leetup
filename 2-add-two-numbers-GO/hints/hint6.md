The time complexity is O(max(m, n)) where m and n are the lengths of the two lists, since you traverse each list at most once. The space complexity is also O(max(m, n)) for the result list, which will have at most max(m, n) + 1 nodes (the extra node is for a potential final carry). This solution is optimal as you must visit every node at least once and create a result node for each digit position.
