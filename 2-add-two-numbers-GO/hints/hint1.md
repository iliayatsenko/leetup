Think about how you learned to add numbers by hand in elementary school - you start from the rightmost digit and move left, carrying over when the sum exceeds 9. Notice that the linked lists are already in reverse order (least significant digit first), which means you can process them from head to tail just like manual addition. What data structure naturally allows you to build a result while traversing two sequences simultaneously?
